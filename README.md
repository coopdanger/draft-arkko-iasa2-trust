# draft-arkko-iasa20-trust

The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF are underoing change within the IASA2 working group. The planned changes include replacing the current IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a newly created organisation with clearly defined interfaces towards the Internet Society and elsewhere. However, changes to IAOC will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well.

This document describes the dependencies between the two, and suggests path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust to become independent of the IAOC changes, and continue its service to the IETF and others largely unchanged.
