          IETF Trust Changes to Accommodate IASA Restructuring
                       draft-arkko-iasa2-trust-00

Abstract

   An ongoing change plans to replace the current IETF Administrative
   Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a newly created
   administrative organisation.  This change will have an impact in the
   IETF Trust as well, primarily because members of the IAOC have also
   served as trustees of the IETF Trust.  This memo describes the
   dependencies between the Trust and the IETF administrative framework,
   and suggests changes to allow the IETF Trust to continue its service
   to the IETF and others, with minimal impact to those services.

1.  Introduction

   The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF
   (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity" (IASA)
   [RFC4071]) are being changed.

   One of the planned changes is to remove the IETF Administrative
   Oversight Committee (IAOC) and replace it with a board that oversees
   a new, formal organisation whose boundaries towards Internet Society
   (ISOC) and elsewhere are clearly defined.

   However, the IAOC is interwtined with another IETF organisation, the
   IETF Trust ([RFC4371]), and as a result, changes to IAOC will also
   impact the IETF Trust.

   This memo describes the dependencies between the Trust and the IETF
   administrative framework, and suggests changes to allow the IETF
   Trust to continue its service to the IETF and others, with minimal
   impact to those services.

   The rest of this document is organised as follows.  Section 2
   describes briefly what the IETF Trust is and how the current
   organisation is arranged.  Section 3 points out the dependencies
   between IETF Trust and the rest of IASA, and how those dependencies
   require action in the context of IASA 2.0 project.  Section 4
   discusses the general approach to these changes, i.e., minimal
   changes and keeping the IETF Trust as its own standalone entity.
   Section 5 describes the specific changes that are needed, along with

   potential alternatives where they exist.  Finally, Section 6
   discusses what needs to be done before these, final changes take
   effect.

2.  Background

   The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain, and
   license certain existing and future intellectual property and other
   property used in connection with the administration of the IETF
   [RFC4371].  The intellectual property is, for instance, rights that
   the IETF contributors grant for text in RFCs and Internet Drafts.
   The IETF Trust also manages trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and
   ietf.org.  The IETF Trust is also serving the broader Internet
   community by holding domains and trademark associated with IANA
   [RFC7979].

   The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the Commonwealth of
   Virginia [Trust-FD].  The budget for IETF Trust [Trust-Budget] is
   covered from the Internet Society and a few other sources.  The main
   expenses relate to legal assistance and domain name and trademark
   registrations.

   Currently, the members of the IAOC are also serving as trustees of
   the IETF Trust.  The founding documents specify persons eligible to
   become trustees as having to be then-current members of the IAOC
   [Trust-FD].  The documents also specify that if for any reason there
   are fewer than three individuals serving as trustees, then the IESG,
   or the IESG's successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint
   one or more individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as
   Trustee(s) until eligible persons can be found.

   In the current system there are eight IAOC members.  They are named
   by the IETF Nominations Committee or NomCom (two members), IESG (one
   member), IAB (one member), Internet Society Board of Trustees (one
   member), along with three ex-officio members via their roles as IETF
   Chair, Internet Society CEO, or IAB Chair.

3.  Dependencies

   The following dependencies exist:

   Trustees

      The IETF Trust depends on having IAOC members as Trustees.  A new
      arrangement for this needs to be found.

   IPR Usage

      The IETF Trust needs to allow organisations to use the trademarks
      and other assets its owns.  As a new legal entity is created for
      IETF administration, it becomes necessary to authorize this new
      entity to use the assets that it needs.

   In addition, for the part of IETF Trust funding coming directly from
   Internet Society today, that arrangement could either stay or be
   changed in some manner.

4.  General Approach

   There are two basic approaches to resolving the dependencies.  One
   could imagine merging all IETF Trust functions in the new IASA
   structure and under the planned new legal entity.  This memo
   advocates a second approach where the IETF Trust is kept independent,
   but its dependencies on, for instance, IAOC members are resolved
   through other means.

   The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part to avoid
   causing too much change for the IETF Trust at a time when the IETF
   administrative structure is ongoing major change.  And, perhaps more
   importantly, the IETF Trust and other administrative IETF process are
   quite different.  While very important, the IETF Trust is a very low
   activity entity where changes, if any, are minimal and gradual.
   There are no pressing issues, and the organisation serves the broader
   Internet community than perhaps the day-to-day and more IETF
   meetings-focused other parts of IASA.

5.  Specific Changes to IETF Trust

   This memo also suggestes that the new IETF administrative entity be
   given rights to use the IETF domain names and trademarks, which seems
   reasonable given that the administrative entity is the one that
   administers the IETF web site anyway.

   Secondly, if we want to keep the IETF Trust separate as discussed in
   Section 4, there needs to be a new way to name trustees.  At the time
   the trustees served both the IETF Trust and the IAOC, many of the
   requirements for naming a particular group of people were driven by
   the IAOC's requirements.  For the IETF Trust in the new model, some
   of those arrangements can be rethought, both in terms of the number
   and source of the trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and
   length of terms.

   Several options are possible, of course.  A newly designed naming
   process could be devised.  This memo argues for relatively limited
   change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF Trust arrangements
   generally working well, and on the relatively modest expected time



Arkko                   Expires December 22, 2018               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           IASA 2.0 and IETF Trust               June 2018


   commitments combined with the need for very careful management of the
   assets.

   As a result, this memo suggests that a smaller group of five trustees
   is sufficient, with two named from by the Nomcom, one named by the
   IESG, one named by the Internet Society Board of Trustees, and the
   IETF Chair as an ex-officio member.

   In addition, the terms for the Nomcom- and IESG-named trustees should
   be set to three years.

      Note: It does not seem necessary for the IAB Chair or the Internet
      Society CEO to be members of the IETF Trust.

   The normal IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
   processes continue to apply [RFC7437].

   The next section discusses what document changes are needed to make
   these changes.

   Finally, this memo suggests that funding arrangements for the IETF
   Trust stay as they are, but for the part of IETF Trust funding that
   comes from Internet Society today be managed via the new
   administrative entity instead.

      An alternative approach would be to make no changes.

5.1.  Required Documentation Changes

   This document, if approved, will revise the current procedures
   defined in [RFC4071] and [RFC4371].

   In addition, the Trust Founding Documents need to be revised to
   specify how trustees can become eligible in the new arrangement.
   Such a revision belongs to the IETF Trust, with community review
   before making a change.

   The rights of the new IETF administrative entity with regards to IETF
   Trust copyright, trademarks, and domain names need to be formally
   acknowledged.  This also an action that belongs to the IETF Trust.

6.  Transition

   The new entity for IETF administration is being set up, and at some
   point, the IAOC will also be discontinued.  Fortunately, there's no
   pressing need to change all the components at the same time.  As
   discussed above (Section 2), the IESG holds the ability to continue
   to name trustees.  Once the changes suggested in Section 5 are in

   place, the IETF Trust will have management nominated in the usual
   manner, and the exceptional IESG process is no longer needed.

   However, the following actions do need to take place when a new
   administrative entity is created:

   o  Any changes to how current Internet Society funding for IETF Trust
      need to be agreed.  Perhaps this agreement can be a part of the
      operating agreement that is being drafted.  And as discussed
      above, it seems logical that the IETF Trust funding will be
      arranged through the new administrative entity.

   o  The new administrative entity needs to be given rights to use the
      IETF domain names and trademarks.  This is normal IETF Trust
      business and can be handled in the usual manner.
