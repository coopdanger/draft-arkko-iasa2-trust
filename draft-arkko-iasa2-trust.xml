    <abstract>

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF are underoing change within the IASA2 working group. The
      planned changes include replacing the current IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a
      newly created organisation with clearly defined interfaces
      towards the Internet Society and elsewhere. However, changes to
      IAOC will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well. This
      document describes the dependencies between the Trust and the
      IASA, and suggests path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust to
      become independent of the IAOC changes, and continue its service
      to the IETF and others largely unchanged.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity"
      (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) were created more than ten
      years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own
      administration.  The arrangements have served the IETF
      reasonably well, but there's been considerable change in the
      necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own
      expectations since the creation of the IASA. As a result, the
      IASA2 working group is proceeding to redefine the structure for
      IETF's administrative support.</t>

      <t>As of the redefinition, the working group is planning to
      remove the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and
      replace it with a board that oversees a new, formal organisation
      whose boundaries towards Internet Society (ISOC) and elsewhere
      are clearly defined.</t>
      
      <t>However, the IAOC's is interwtined with another IETF
      organisation, the IETF Trust (<xref target="RFC4371"/>), and as
      a result, changes to IAOC will also impact the IETF Trust.</t>
      
      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe those impacts,
      and suggest path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust's role to
      be defined independently of IAOC, and continue its important
      service to the IETF and other communities otherwise
      unchanged.</t>

      <t>The rest of this document is organised as follows. <xref
      target="background"/> describes what the IETF Trust is and how
      the current organisation is arranged. <xref
      target="dependencies"/> points out the depencies between IETF
      Trust and the rest of IASA, and how those dependencies require
      action in the context of IASA 2.0 project. <xref
      target="approach"/> discusses the general approach to these
      changes, i.e., minimal changes and keeping the IETF Trust as its
      own standalone entity. <xref target="changes"/> describes the
      specific changes that are needed, along with potential
      alternatives where they exist. Finally, <xref
      target="transition"/> discusses what needs to be done before
      these, final changes take effect.</t>

    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      
      <t>The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,
      and license certain existing and future intellectual property
      and other property used in connection with the administration of
      the IETF <xref target="RFC4371"/>.</t>
      
      <t>In practical terms, when IETF contributors submit materials
      for RFCs and Internet Drafts, they grant the IETF Trust gets
      some rights <xref target="RFC5378"/>. The IETF Trust also
      manages trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and ietf.org. The
      IETF Trust is also serving the broader Internet community by
      holding domains and trademark associated with IANA <xref
      target="RFC7979"/>.</t>
