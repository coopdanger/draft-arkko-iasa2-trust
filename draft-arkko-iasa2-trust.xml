      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF are underoing change within the IASA2 working group. The
      planned changes include replacing the current IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a
      newly created organisation with clearly defined interfaces
      towards the Internet Society and elsewhere. However, changes to
      IAOC will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well. This
      document describes the dependencies between the Trust and the
      IASA, and suggests path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust to
      become independent of the IAOC changes, and continue its service
      to the IETF and others largely unchanged.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity"
      (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) were created more than ten
      years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own
      administration.  The arrangements have served the IETF
      reasonably well, but there's been considerable change in the
      necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own
      expectations since the creation of the IASA. As a result, the
      IASA2 working group is proceeding to redefine the structure for
      IETF's administrative support.</t>

      <t>As of the redefinition, the working group is planning to
      remove the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and
      replace it with a board that oversees a new, formal organisation
      whose boundaries towards Internet Society (ISOC) and elsewhere
      are clearly defined.</t>
      
      <t>However, the IAOC's is interwtined with another IETF
      organisation, the IETF Trust (<xref target="RFC4371"/>), and as
      a result, changes to IAOC will also impact the IETF Trust.</t>
      
      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe those impacts,
      and suggest path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust's role to
      be defined independently of IAOC, and continue its important
      service to the IETF and other communities otherwise
      unchanged.</t>

      <t>The rest of this document is organised as follows. <xref
      target="background"/> describes what the IETF Trust is and how
      the current organisation is arranged. <xref
      target="dependencies"/> points out the depencies between IETF
      Trust and the rest of IASA, and how those dependencies require
      action in the context of IASA 2.0 project. <xref
      target="approach"/> discusses the general approach to these
      changes, i.e., minimal changes and keeping the IETF Trust as its
      own standalone entity. <xref target="changes"/> describes the
      specific changes that are needed, along with potential
      alternatives where they exist. Finally, <xref
      target="transition"/> discusses what needs to be done before
      these, final changes take effect.</t>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="background" title="Background">
      
      <t>The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain,
      and license certain existing and future intellectual property
      and other property used in connection with the administration of
      the IETF <xref target="RFC4371"/>.</t>
      
      <t>In practical terms, when IETF contributors submit materials
      such as those intended for publication as an RFC, they grant the
      IETF Trust gets some rights <xref target="RFC5378"/>. The IETF
      Trust also manages trademarks and domains such as "IETF" and
      ietf.org. The IETF Trust is also serving the broader Internet
      community by holding domains and trademark associated with IANA
      <xref target="RFC7979"/>.</t>
      
      <t>The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in District of
      Columbia <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.  It has a budget and is
      currently entirely funded by Internet Society. The 2018 expenses
      are expected to be 65,000 USD, or about 1% of overall IETF
      expenses <xref target="Trust-Budget"/>. The main expenses relate
      to legal assistance and domain name and trademark registrations
      throughout the world.</t>
      
      <t>Currently, the members of the IAOC are also serving as
      trustees of the IETF Trust. The founding documents specify
      persons eligible to become trustees as having to be then-current
      members of the IAOC <xref target="Trust-FD"/>.  The documents
      also specify that if for any reason there are fewer than three
      individuals serving as trustees, then the IESG, or the IESG's
      successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or
      more individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s)
      until eligible persons can be found.</t>

      <t>In the current system there are eight IAOC members. They are
      named by the IETF Nominations Committee or NomCom (two members),
      IESG (one member), IAB (one member), Internet Society Board of
      Trustees (one member), along with three ex-officio members via
      their roles as IETF Chair, Internet Society CEO, or IAB
      Chair.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="dependencies" title="Dependencies">
      
      <t>The following dependencies exist:
      <list style="hanging">

	<t hangText="Trustees"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The IETF Trust
	depends on having IAOC members as Trustees. A new arrangement
	for this needs to be found.</t>
	
	<t hangText="Funding"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The IETF Trust
	continues to need a budget to manage its assets. As funding
	arrangements are changed in the rest of the system, it becomes
	necessary to specify how the IETF Trust is funded going
	forward, and if there's any change to the current
	arrangement.</t>

	<t hangText="IPR Usage"><vspace blankLines="1"/> The IETF
	Trust needs to allow organisations to use the trademarks and
	other assets its owns. As a new legal entity is created for
	IETF administration, it becomes necessary to authorize
	this new entity to use the assets that it needs.</t>
	
      </list></t>
      
    </section>
      
    <section anchor="approach" title="General Approach">
	
      <t>There are two basic approaches to resolving the
      dependencies. One could imagine merging all IETF Trust functions
      in the new IASA structure and under the planned new legal
      entity. This memo advocates a second approach where the IETF
      Trust is kept independent, but its dependencies on, for instance,
      IAOC members are resolved through other means.</t>
      
      <t>The rationale for advocating the second approach is in part
      to avoid causing too much change for the IETF Trust at a time
      when the IETF administrative structure is ongoing major change.
      And, perhaps more importantly, the IETF Trust and other
      administrative IETF process are quite different. While very
      important, the IETF Trust is a very low activity entity where
      changes, if any, are minimal and gradual. There are no pressing
      issues, and the organisation serves the broader Internet
      community than perhaps the day-to-day and more IETF
      meetings-focused other parts of IASA.</t>
      
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="changes" title="Specific Changes to IETF Trust">

      <t>The memo suggests that funding for IETF Trust be centralized
      to come from the new IETF administrative support entity. One of
      the goals of the new entity is to be better in charge of all
      costs and income associated with the IETF, and putting the IETF
      Trust costs in the same place seems practical and reasonable.

      <list style="empty">
	
	<t>An alternative model would be to continue to use funding
	directly from ISOC.</t>
	
      </list></t>

      <t>This memo also suggestes that the new IETF administrative entity
      be given rights to use the IETF domain names and trademarks,
      which seems reasonable given that the administrative entity is the
      one that administers the IETF web site anyway.</t>

      <t>Finally, if we want to keep the IETF Trust separate as
      discussed in <xref target="approach"/>, there needs to be a new
      way to name trustees. At the time the trustees served both the
      IETF Trust and the IAOC, many of the requirements for naming a
      particular group of people were driven by the IAOC's requirements.
      For the IETF Trust in the new model, some of those arrangements
      can be rethought, both in terms of the number and source of
      the trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and length of
      terms.</t>

      <t>Several options are possible, of course. A newly designed
      naming process could be devised. This memo argues for relatively
      limited change, however, largely on the basis of the IETF Trust
      arrangements generally working well, and on the relatively modest
      expected time commitments combined with the need for very careful
      management of the assets.</t>
      
      <t>As a result, this memo suggests that a smaller group of five
      trustees is sufficient, with two named from by the Nomcom, one
      named by the IESG, one named by the Internet Society Board of
      Trustees, and the IETF Chair as an ex-officio member.</t>

      <t>In addition, the terms for the Nomcom- and IESG-named
      trustees should be set to three years.

      <list style="empty">

	<t>Note: It does not seem necessary for the IAB Chair or the
	Internet Society CEO to be members of the IETF Trust.</t>
	
      </list></t>
      
      <t>The normal IETF rules regarding recalls and other Nomcom-related
      processes continue to apply <xref target="RFC3777"/>.</t>

      <t>The next section discusses what document changes are needed
      to make these changes.</t>
      
      <section title="Required Documentation Changes">

	<t>This document, if approved, will revise the current
	procedures defined in <xref target="RFC4071"/> and <xref
	target="RFC4371"/>.</t>
	
	<t>In addition, the Trust Founding Documents need to be
	revised to specify how trustees can become eligible in the new
	arrangement. Such a revision belongs to the IETF Trust, with
	community review before making a change.</t>
	
	<t>The rights of the new IETF administrative entity with
	regards to IETF Trust copyright, trademarks, and domain names
	need to be formally acknowledged. This also an action that
	belongs to the IETF Trust.</t>

      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section anchor="transition" title="Transition">

      <t>The new entity for IETF administration is being set up, and
      at some point, the IAOC will also be discontinued. Fortunately,
      there's no pressing need to change all the components at the
      same time. As discussed above (<xref target="background"/>), the
      IESG holds the ability to continue to name trustees. Once the
      changes suggested in <xref target="changes"/> are in place, the
      IETF Trust will have management nominated in the usual manner,
      and the exceptional IESG process is no longer needed.</t>

      <t>However, the following actions do need to take place
      when a new administrative entity is created:
      <list style="symbols">
	
	<t>There needs to be an agreement between the IETF and
	Internet Society that the IETF Trust shall be funded by either
	the Internet Society directly or through the new
	administrative entity. Perhaps this agreement can be a part of
	the operating agreement that is being drafted. And as discussed above,
	it seems logical that the IETF Trust funding will be arranged through the
	new administrative entity.</t>
	
	<t>The new administrative entity needs to be given rights to
	use the IETF domain names and trademarks. This is normal IETF
	Trust business and can be handled in the usual manner.</t>
	
      </list></t>
