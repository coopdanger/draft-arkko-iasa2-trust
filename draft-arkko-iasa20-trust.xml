    <abstract>

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF are underoing change within the IASA2 working group. The
      planned changes include replacing the current IETF
      Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with a board for a
      newly created organisation with clearly defined interfaces
      towards the Internet Society and elsewhere. However, changes to
      IAOC will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well. This
      document describes the dependencies between the two, and
      suggests path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust to become
      independent of the IAOC changes, and continue its service to the
      IETF and others largely unchanged.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the
      IETF (referred to as the "IETF Administrative Support Activity"
      (IASA) <xref target="RFC4071"/>) were created more than ten
      years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own
      administration.  The arrangements have served the IETF
      reasonably well, but there's been considerable change in the
      necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own
      expectations since the creation of the IASA. As a result, the
      IASA2 working group is proceeding to redefine the structure for
      IETF's administrative support.</t>

      <t>As of the redefinition, the working group is planning to
      remove the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and
      replace it with a board that oversees a new, formal organisation
      whose boundaries towards Internet Society (ISOC) and elsewhere
      are clearly defined.</t>
      
      <t>However, the IAOC's is interwtined with another IETF
      organisation, the IETF Trust (<xref target="RFC4371"/>
      and <xref target="RFC5378"/>, and as a result, changes
      to IAOC will also impact the IETF Trust.</t>
      
      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe those impacts,
      and suggest path(s) forward that allow the IETF Trust's role to
      be defined independently of IAOC, and continue its important
      service to the IETF and other communities otherwise
      unchanged.</t>
